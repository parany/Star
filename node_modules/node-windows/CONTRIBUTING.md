Please make sure you review the README, especially the updates, before submitting anything.

**Contributions must be cross-platform compatible...** node-windows/mac/linux share a common API.

It is also important to note that a new project, [Daemon Manager](http://github.com/coreybutler/daemon-manager), has been in the 
works for a while now. This module is not yet at a release point and I will not be accepting contributions until it is. The
daemon manager is an abstraction of all the common wrapping functionality for Windows, OSX, and Linux. This is how the API
will remain consistent across operating systems.

## NGN

node-windows/mac/linux were built to support [NGN](http://github.com/nodengn). NGN is a Node.js-based microservice platform.
In accordance to the Microservice/POA/SOA approach, it uses multiple independent but connected processes to support apps/systems.
These processes are controlled with the node-* modules.

It has been in the works for almost 2yrs and is slated for a pre-release when Node 0.12.x launches. The node-* series
will progress in accordance to milestone accomplishments with NGN (which should be plentiful soon).
